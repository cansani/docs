<Tip>
  **To authenticate with our API you need an API key**: It is with this key that our API identifies your account and allows you to send requests successfully.
</Tip>

### Managing API keys

You can list, create and invalidate your API keys within our platform.

If your API key is not entered in the header, is invalid or revoked, our API will return the HTTP 401 code.

  Authentication via JWT is not yet implemented, but will be required in future versions of the API.
  For now, you can test it by clicking <a href="https://viewto.me/demo">here</a>.
